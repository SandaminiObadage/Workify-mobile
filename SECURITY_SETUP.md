# ðŸš¨ SECURITY SETUP REQUIRED

## Firebase Configuration Security

Your Firebase API keys were accidentally exposed publicly. Follow these steps to secure your app:

### 1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION - Regenerate API Keys**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services â†’ Credentials**
3. Find and **REGENERATE** these compromised keys:
   - Android API Key
   - iOS API Key  
   - Web API Key

### 2. **Update Firebase Configuration**
1. Copy `lib/firebase_options.template.dart` to `lib/firebase_options.dart`
2. Replace the placeholder API keys with your new regenerated keys:
   ```dart
   // Replace these placeholders:
   apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_ANDROID_API_KEY_HERE',
   apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_IOS_API_KEY_HERE',
   apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_WEB_API_KEY_HERE',
   ```

### 3. **Verify Security**
- âœ… `lib/firebase_options.dart` is now in `.gitignore`
- âœ… New API keys are restricted (see Google Cloud Console)
- âœ… Old keys are regenerated and invalidated

### 4. **Running the App**
After updating with new API keys:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices
- Never commit `firebase_options.dart` to public repositories
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Set up API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
